# Test Blog Post

This is a test blog post created to verify that the blog post management system is working correctly.

## Features to Test

- **Creation**: Can we create new blog posts?
- **Editing**: Can we edit existing blog posts?
- **Deletion**: Can we delete blog posts?
- **Filtering**: Can we filter by tags and authors?
- **Preview**: Does the MDX preview work correctly?

## MDX Features

Here are some MDX features that should work:

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, GitMesh CE!");
}
```

### Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two
- Bullet point three

### Links and Emphasis

This is a [link to GitMesh](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/gitmesh) and this is **bold text** and this is *italic text*.

> This is a blockquote to test styling.

## Conclusion

If you can see this content properly formatted, the blog post management system is working correctly!
