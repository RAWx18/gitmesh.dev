# 🔎 gitmesh ce

gitmesh ce is a **developer data platform (DDP)** that lets companies centralize all touch points developers have with their product and brand - be it in community (e.g. Stack Overflow or Reddit), product (open-source or SaaS), or commercial channels (e.g. HubSpot).

gitmesh ce pulls data from a variety of different sources, normalizes it, matches identities across platforms, and enriches it with 3rd party data. The result is a unified 360-view of who the developers are that engage with your product and community, which companies they work for, and where they stand in their personal customer journey.

gitmesh ce is open-source, built with developers in mind, available for both hosted and self-hosted deployments, open to extensions, and offers full control over your data.&#x20;
