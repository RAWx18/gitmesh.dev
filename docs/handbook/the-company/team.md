# 🧑🤝🧑 Team

### Jonathan Reimer (CEO) 🇩🇪

Jonathan was born and raised in Germany with 5 siblings. After his dream of becoming a basketball player burst, he studied economics & computer science in Bonn, where he also had his first touch points with developers' tools and the world of open-source.

Besides running the company, Jonathan is doing a lot of sports, listening to (and playing) electronic & hip-hop music, and traveling.

### Nuno Eufrásio (Product Designer) 🇵🇹

Nuno was born and grew up in Coimbra, a small city in Portugal known for holding one of the oldest universities in the world. Passionate about maps, data visualization, and magazine illustrations since he remembers, always knew his journey would fall into some sort of creative field. After getting his degree in Communication and Multimedia Design, and spending some time playing the graphic design role, he slowly started moving into the UX field, where he feels most comfortable. During the last 8 years, he’s been helping businesses craft digital user experiences and ease people’s lives, focusing his work around usability, accessibility, and aesthetics. Currently, is taking the lead in [gitmesh ce](http://gitmesh.ce/)’s product design and building bridges between its customers and the development team. When not at work, you won’t find Nuno getting tanned and riding waves at some Portuguese beach or surf sanctuary, as he rather prefers the peacefulness of the mountains and the adrenaline of ski slopes.

### Charlotte Schmitt (Chief of Staff) 🇩🇪

Charlotte is from Germany, but after only 8 short months, her family moved abroad, and she lived in Moscow for 16 years. She then moved to Frankfurt for her Bachelor's in Economics and Business and worked in Marketing at larger corporates. After realizing that was not for her, she completed a Master of Management at ESCP in Berlin and Paris with a focus on entrepreneurship and worked at a MedTech Startup. Then, as you do coming out of business school, she spent two years in consulting before starting her own company SaveSpace. Now at gitmesh ce, beyond her CoS duties, she is known for trying to get everyone on the social calls, encouraging people to work out with her on offsites, and referencing the latest Tim Ferriss or Huberman podcast.&#x20;

### Igor Kotua (Software Engineer) 🇷🇺

He first studied computer science before switching to aero physics, only to realize after graduation that he would, in the end, pursue computer science.
