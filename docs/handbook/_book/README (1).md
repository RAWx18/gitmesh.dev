# 👋 What is GitMesh CE?

GitMesh CE is a suite of tools to analyze, grow, and **leverage developer communities to drive business growth**.

Essentially, [GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) helps unlock the value of communities for DevTool businesses. **Having a solid community strategy is a largely underrated and untapped tool for growth.** This is largely due to the fact that it is a relatively novel, difficult and largely manual task, with community members spread across channels. It is also a more reactive activity to-date (e.g., answering support questions) and **most people don’t know how to turn their community into real business outcomes.**

**GitMesh CE is here to change this.** Self-hosted or hosted by us, with developers in mind, open to extensions, and with full control over your community's data. With [GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) you can instantly unify all your community channels into one dashboard and unearth actionable insights to grow your business.

#### What makes us different from other community building tools?

While other [community tools exist](https://www.notion.so/e98cd0e40e95401a80b99f14852a8102?pvs=21), we are the only ones **building specifically for DevTools** and their communities in mind. We also believe that ultimately an **open-source** platform will lead in the market. With an open-source approach [GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) can be the go-to solution for even the most regulated industries and harness our community to build out our product further.
