This included understanding the full developer user journey from initial interest, to community engagement, to avid usage and sales. He was soon frustrated that the work required him to switch between endless platforms and work with incomplete data. He also realized there were no tools available that had all the integrations and features he needed for the developer space - especially classical CRMs and CDPs lacked features for a developer-led growth approach. So he started working on his own solution.\n2021 - GitMesh CE gets founded 🐣\nWorking on a solution that was making his own life more manageable, Jonathan figured out that other companies struggled with the same problems. So he teamed up with Joan (Co-Founder, CTO), who himself was an avid community member of several open-source communities, and they decided to found GitMesh CE. They also started to think about the future and that GitMesh CE should be open-source. This would allow us to build a strong developer community around GitMesh CE that could add use cases to the software. After releasing our first MVP, it was clear that there was interest. Developer-focused companies found GitMesh CE and signed up for the alpha version. At the same time, Jonathan and Joan started to build out our team with the first engineers.\n2022 - Going open-source with €2.2m in funding 🎉\nTo incorporate all the valuable feedback from early users, it was time to bring in external funding to accelerate the building process. We found supportive and knowledgeable investors who believed in GitMesh CE's mission to be the developer data tool of choice for developer-focused companies. With that, GitMesh CE hired more passionate individuals to keep the momentum going and grew the team to 10 people. \nWe released our open-source product into the world with enhanced applications and features to help DevTools collect and understand their developer data. We have a strong belief that our open-source approach will create value beyond our own product offering. We want to collaborate with everyone to build software for the developer-led era and create a vibrant and open ecosystem around our project. If you want to go far, go together.\n2023 - Nailing strong product-market fit 🎯 \nThe goal for this year is to nail strong product-market fit. Countless DevTools - including some of the world's leading open-source organizations - are already happy users of GitMesh CE and use our product on a regular basis to understand their developer journey, manage their developer community, or identify sales opportunities within their data.\nOur team of 12 is now supported by a growing open source community and we look forward with excitement to the months ahead.\n2027 - The leading developer data platform 🏆 \nWatch this space.\n"},"the-company/team.html":{"url":"the-company/team.html","title":"🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Team","summary":"Get to know the people behind GitMesh CE (sorted by date they joined)","keywords":"","body":"🧑🤝🧑 Team\nJonathan Reimer (CEO) 🇩🇪\nJonathan was born and raised in Germany with 5 siblings. After his dream of becoming a basketball player burst, he studied economics & computer science in Bonn, where he also had his first touch points with developers' tools and the world of open-source. After being Head of Business Development at Code Intelligence, he went on and advised several open-source and developer-focussed companies before starting GitMesh CE together with Joan. Besides running the company, Jonathan is doing a lot of sports, listening to (and playing) electronic & hip-hop music, and traveling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoan Reyero (CTO) 🇪🇸\nJoan is from Barcelona and based in Berlin but thinks Cambridge is the best city in the world. His hidden talent is being able to drink his morning coffee in the shower. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnil Bostanci (Software Engineer) 🇹🇷\nAnil is from Turkey and is based in Berlin. During our Croatia offsite, he lost his engagement ring on a boat trip, losing a bet with his now-wife on who would lose their ring first. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUroš Marolt (Software Engineer) 🇸🇮\nUroš joined GitMesh CE as Senior Software Engineer. He has 12 years of experience under his belt, having been CTO and co-founder of his previous venture, as well as having worked as a Senior Software Developer before that. When he is not coding, Uroš spends his time with his wife and new son, exploring his home country - Slovenia. With any free time left after that Uros loves to get in some gaming (CSGO, Apex, Simracing), mountain biking, or an NBA match. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNuno Eufrásio (Product Designer) 🇵🇹\nNuno was born and grew up in Coimbra, a small city in Portugal known for holding one of the oldest universities in the world. Passionate about maps, data visualization, and magazine illustrations since he remembers, always knew his journey would fall into some sort of creative field. After getting his degree in Communication and Multimedia Design, and spending some time playing the graphic design role, he slowly started moving into the UX field, where he feels most comfortable. During the last 8 years, he’s been helping businesses craft digital user experiences and ease people’s lives, focusing his work around usability, accessibility, and aesthetics. Currently, is taking the lead in GitMesh CE’s product design and building bridges between its customers and the development team. When not at work, you won’t find Nuno getting tanned and riding waves at some Portuguese beach or surf sanctuary, as he rather prefers the peacefulness of the mountains and the adrenaline of ski slopes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharlotte Schmitt (Chief of Staff) 🇩🇪\nCharlotte is from Germany, but after only 8 short months, her family moved abroad, and she lived in Moscow for 16 years. She then moved to Frankfurt for her Bachelor's in Economics and Business and worked in Marketing at larger corporates. After realizing that was not for her, she completed a Master of Management at ESCP in Berlin and Paris with a focus on entrepreneurship and worked at a MedTech Startup. Then, as you do coming out of business school, she spent two years in consulting before starting her own company SaveSpace. Now at GitMesh CE, beyond her CoS duties, she is known for trying to get everyone on the social calls, encouraging people to work out with her on offsites, and referencing the latest Tim Ferriss or Huberman podcast. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoana Maia (Product Lead) 🇵🇹\nJoana is our Product Lead and also a Frontend Developer. She originally worked in web design and UI/UX until she realized she had a passion for Frontend development. She made the switch and then worked for several years at a later-stage startup in Portugal, Coimbra, her hometown, as a Frontend Developer. Joana loves all things music and plays the guitar in her free time. She is a big sports fan, especially football. She also enjoys cooking and envisions one day running an out-of-the-box restaurant. \\\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIgor Kotua (Software Engineer) 🇷🇺\nBefore GitMesh CE, Igor worked at open-source-focused VC, Runa Capital, so he has seen all the open-source business models and metrics out there. And speaking of metrics, he’s grown a GitHub repo from 0 to 12,000 with 70+ contributors already 📈🤩. He first studied computer science before switching to aero physics, only to realize after graduation that he would, in the end, pursue computer science. Outside of coding, Igor loves to build cool side-projects and hitting the slopes skiing and snowboarding in the winter. He also likes a nice bike ride while getting up to speed on his favorite podcasts.  \n.jpg>)\\\nGašper Grom (Software Engineer) 🇸🇮\nGasper Grom is a software developer from Slovenia.

For each area, they should give a small report on its status.\n\nThe status report should include:\nWhat was the development in the past week?\nIf tasks were ongoing, are they on track?\nIf there has not been any progress or improvements in your area in some weeks, explain why (except for more straightforward areas, like Emails or signals).\n\n\nThe prompt will also ask you if you need any time during the cycle meeting on Friday to talk about any of your areas.

By following the process outlined in the How to report issues section, we can ensure that the entire team knows the product's backlog and that everyone is accountable for maintaining the product.\nBelow is a list of custom views that provide insight into how the team can use them throughout the product's lifecycle:\n🛟 Support\n\nAll issues reported by customers.\nIt allows the support person to monitor the issues' status and the issue manager to prioritize issues.\n\n:arrow_forward: Current Cycle\n\nAll issues worked on in the current cycle, excluding support-related ones.\nIt helps the team to manage their work and measure progress and success. During the cycle review, there is a discussion of the unresolved issues.\n\n:checkered_flag: Ready to be picked up:\n\nOverview of all issues in the TODO state (planned but not started), grouped by project. In the same view, apart from the projects' columns, there is also a column named No project, for all issues outside a project.\nFor issues within a project or without a project, the sorting is done by priority so that the team has a clear visualization of the most important issues they should handle next.\nIt helps to identify issues ready to be addressed within each part of the product. It also guides the discussion on which issues to move into the upcoming cycle during cycle planning.\n\n:ship: Cycle Plan\n\nAll planned issues, grouped by assignee, for the upcoming cycle.\nIt is used as a reference to ensure the team is adequately scoped and not overcommitted.\n\n:open_file_folder: Areas of Ownership\n\nEach area of ownership has its own view, filtered by label. Each view is grouped by status and ordered by priority.\nThe designated area owner is responsible for maintaining the issues within that area. This view should be used to ensure issues are placed in the correct status. This can be easily achieved by:\nkeeping track of the ones in progress;\nplanning the most important ones and moving them into the TODO state after;\ncontinuously checking the ones that are still in a discovery phase by keeping them in the backlog.\n\n\n\n"},"product-and-engineering/project-based-development.html":{"url":"product-and-engineering/project-based-development.html","title":"⚒️ Project-based development","keywords":"","body":"⚒️ Project-based development\nWhat does it mean to work with project-based development?\nThe majority of the work will be planned, iterated, and developed within projects.

These updates will be done in Linear through #project-updates or #non-project-tasks-updates.\nThe #daily-standup slack channel will be synced with Linear to reflect everyone's work. This means that all product-development updates done through Linear, will automatically trigger a notification on Slack.\nProject updates\nLinear allows giving status reports on the health of the projects. Each project lead will be responsible for providing these updates on a daily basis and syncing with any project members if needed.\nWithin a project update, you should first update the project's health, followed by a comment. The comment should be especially descriptive if the project is not on tracked, or if it's blocked. You can refer to Linear's documentation on Project Updates for guidance on how to do it properly.\nEach update will trigger a notification to Slack's #daily-standup channel, and any related discussion can be done in the thread.\nNon-project tasks updates\nSome tasks might not belong to any project. For these tasks, the assignee should provide a daily status update in the task's comments.\nEach update will trigger a notification to Slack's #daily-standup channel, and any related discussion can be conducted in the thread.\nReminders\nSlack\nEveryone will receive a daily reminder in Slack at 08:00 CET to provide their daily update.

When you pick up a ticket, ensure you are assigned and keep the status current. Linear will be the source of truth for project owners, customer support, and all your teammates, so we must be disciplined to keep tickets updated.\nThis is the lifecycle of a ticket with all its possible statuses:\n\nBacklog: the ticket is not planned yet.\nTodo: it's planned but not started.\nIn progress: it's actively being worked on.\nIn review: in code review and/or in staging.\nDone: Merged and deployed to production.\n\nBranches naming and convention\nWhen creating a branch, we always use one of the following prefixes:\n\nfeature/: when it is a new feature or a big improvement. These will usually be the biggest pull requests.\nimprovement/: a reasonably small enhancement for an existing feature.\nbugfix/: when the pull request is fixing a bug.\ndocumentation/: for branches that will only update docs.\n\nDeploying to staging\nWe should deploy to staging for all tickets that are not an emergency to ensure they will work in the production environment. To learn more about deploying to staging, check our docs.\nOpening pull requests\nWhen opening a pull request, there are two conventions we need to follow:\n\nAlways add a human-readable name that will give enough context to whoever reads it. Every Tuesday, Joan will go through all of the pull requests to add them to the changelog, and having meaningful names will make the job smoother.\nAssign a label to the pull request. It should be one of Bug, Improvement, Feature, or Documentation. We have a release drafter that will collect all the pull requests of the week and come up with version numbers and sectioning automatically based on these labels.\nSelect an expert or owner on the area where the pull request belongs for review. Do not open a pull request without assigning a reviewer.\n\nGitHub copilot will write a detailed description for the pull request, so you don't need to worry about it. However, if it's front-end changes, screenshots are appreciated!\nDeploying to production\nOnce the task has been finalized, it's time to merge and deploy! Deploying to production is outlined in the deployment docs.\nAlways deploy to production as soon as the ticket is ready, unless there is a very good reason not to.

If the issue is part of an active project, assign it to that project and talk to the project owner. Otherwise, how we treat the issue will depend on its priority.\nWhen writing issues, be as descriptive as possible to avoid back-and-forth communication after. Some guidelines:\n\nAdd a title that lets an informed reader understand the issue without opening it.\nAdd a description that explains the issue in detail. It should give some context, such as why we must do this. If you are an engineer and you understand the context, get technical.\n\nIf you are reporting a bug, add steps to reproduce it. Looms and screenshots will be your friends here!\nWhen should an issue be synced with GitHub?\nWe use Cal.com's SyncLinear to sync GitHub issues to Linear and vice-versa.

He will then re-assign it if needed. If you are an engineer and the issue is in one of your areas of knowledge, provide an estimate.\n\nPriority: Urgent or High.\nAssign: Joan, or if you know who should tackle it, them.\nLabel: Usually Bug, but could also be Improvement.\nEstimate: Provide an estimate if you can. Otherwise, leave it blank.\n\nMedium or low-priority issues\nMedium or low-priority issues can go straight to the backlog and stay unassigned.\n\nPriority: Medium or Low.\nAssign: No one\nLabel: Usually Improvement or Feature, but it could also be Bug.\n\nArea of ownership\nEach issue should be marked with its area of ownership. This is crucial to organize them. There are labels created for that in Linear. Please refer to the areas-of-ownership.md for a description of each area, if you need. If you are still unsure, ask the Product Lead.\nIssues by the community\nCommunity members can raise issues in GitHub. The person in charge of support should give a first reply acknowledging the issue and thanking the contributor for opening it.\nTo send the issue to Linear, add the Linear label in GitHub. Then follow the same priority-based procedure as with issues opened directly in Linear, and add an Area of Ownership.\n"},"product-and-engineering/how-to-estimate-issues.html":{"url":"product-and-engineering/how-to-estimate-issues.html","title":"⌚ How to estimate issues","keywords":"","body":"⌚ How to estimate issues\nEstimating the time an issue will take is important to plan our weeks efficiently.

Integrations are the most common emergency and will be treated separately.\nGeneral emergencies\nIn a general emergency, keeping a cool head and communicating are essential.\n\nWhen reporting the emergency, open a Slack thread with the 🚨 reaction. When reporting, try to gather as much information as possible so research can be started in the right direction.\nResearch what the owners and/or experts might be failing, and tag them in the thread.\nIf you are an expert, drop what you are doing and start fixing the emergency.\nIf you are out of the office, find another expert.\nIf you are working on another emergency, find another expert or contact Jonathan or Joan to see which one has more priority.\n\n\nKeep the thread up to date to inform others of what you have tried. This way, we will reach a solution together quicker.\n\nIntegration errors\nThe goal is always to ensure we have complete data for all integrations without bothering the user. Even if there are errors.\nThe integration framework is designed such that if part of an integration fails, the rest will continue to fetch data. If there is an error, usually the data loss is minimal. Therefore, it is acceptable to delay the error reporting to the user by three days, during which we have time to fix the error and get back the missing data.\nWhen an error occurs, we will get a Slack notification. This error will become a top priority for the engineer in charge of integrations. We have three days to fix, re-deploy, and get the missing data.\nSome guidelines\n\nAlways create a ticket for each issue. When the issue is fixed, add a couple of lines explaining what caused it.\nIf errors are piling up, paid customers take priority. Otherwise, we can fix them in chronological order.\nIf some errors would not be fixed in the three days, ask for help!\n\nErrors caused by a failure of external API\nUnresponsive APIs cause some errors we need to get data. For example, some weeks ago, the LinkedIn API was down for several days. In this case, we should inform the user of the problems and clarify that we cannot control this and that they will get their data back.\nFor this, we have a new integration status, called external-error, that will inform the user of what is happening.\nWhen the API is available again, we must get the missing data.\nResponse time and the process of handling errors\nDelaying the error notifications relies heavily on two assumptions: we will know when integrations went wrong and have a system in place to fix these issues quickly. I will set up a channel that alerts about faulty integrations in Slack. As soon as we get a message there, Igor will look into the bug and fix it. One of his main responsibilities will be to ensure there are no errored integrations, fix the bugs before we need to alert the user, and set the error type as external when needed. This task will take priority over any of his other development or growth tasks.\n"},"product-and-engineering/reviewing-pull-requests.html":{"url":"product-and-engineering/reviewing-pull-requests.html","title":"✅ Reviewing pull requests","summary":"Description of what to look for when reviewing a PR","keywords":"","body":"✅ Reviewing pull requests\nMake sure all checks are passing.\nAll automated checks (linting, formatting, and testing) must be passed.

The owner of the area of ownership for that specific feature is responsible for features having been battle-tested enough to be open to all users.\nInvolving external help\nWhen to ask for help\nThere are three cases where it is always okay to ask for external help:\n\nWe are delivering a milestone for an enterprise customer: when working with enterprise customers, the development paradigm changes: we have a set of milestones that we need to achieve, and the requirements are precise and previously agreed upon. Therefore, it makes sense to get external QA help to ensure our clients get what we promised.\nDeveloping a new integration: integrations are sometimes tricky to test, and it's almost impossible to write automated tests. It's also a crucial part of GitMesh CE, and we must ensure they are solid. We can get external help for this.\nA change can potentially affect multiple other parts: sometimes, we might have to change our core data structure, add new entities, or change how existing entities relate to each other. These cases can affect the functionality of the whole app, and doing the regressions can be time-consuming.\n\nThere might be other cases where we might need external QA. The area owner can send a message to Joan, giving short but proper arguments as to why it is needed.\nHow to ask for help\nTo ask for help, create a new issue in Linear with the QA label, and assign it to our freelancer QA engineer. You should clarify in the issue description what the feature is, what it should be doing, and what should be tested. Feel free to point to any existing documentation.\nThe QA process when external help is involved\nThe QA goes through the prepared steps/documentation in the ticket and tries to gather as much helpful information as possible before the testing session.\nTesting process:\n\nTest the happy path.\nTest edge cases and try to manipulate/break the intended behavior of the tested feature.\nIf any defects or issues are found during testing, document them in the subtask section of the QA ticket and assign the ticket to the developer in charge.\nDevelopers should address the reported defects and fix the issues. If the reported issue is already known or planned for another future milestone. In that case, the developer should close the created ticket and provide some information in the comment section of the ticket.\nAfter fixing, the QA should retest the affected areas to ensure the defects are resolved.\n\n"},"go-to-market/internal.html":{"url":"go-to-market/internal.html","title":"📈 Internal","keywords":"","body":"📈 Internal\nPlease find the Go-To-Market section in the internal handbook (only available for team members).\n"}}}
