<h3 id="2020---the-pain-of-incomplete-developer-data-&#x1F622;">2020 - The pain of incomplete developer data &#x1F622;</h3>
<p>Before GitMesh CE, our Co-Founder and CEO, Jonathan, was responsible for Go-To-Market at a DevTool company. This included understanding the full developer user journey from initial interest, to community engagement, to avid usage and sales. He was soon frustrated that the work required him to switch between endless platforms and work with incomplete data. He also realized there were no tools available that had all the integrations and features he needed for the developer space - especially classical CRMs and CDPs lacked features for a developer-led growth approach. So he started working on his own solution.</p>
<h3 id="2021---gitmeshdev-gets-founded-&#x1F423;">2021 - GitMesh CE gets founded &#x1F423;</h3>
<p>Working on a solution that was making his own life more manageable, Jonathan figured out that other companies struggled with the same problems. So he teamed up with Joan (Co-Founder, CTO), who himself was an avid community member of several open-source communities, and they decided to found GitMesh CE. They also started to think about the future and that GitMesh CE should be open-source. This would allow us to build a strong developer community around GitMesh CE that could add use cases to the software. After releasing our first MVP, it was clear that there was interest. Developer-focused companies found GitMesh CE and signed up for the alpha version. At the same time, Jonathan and Joan started to build out our team with the first engineers.</p>
<h3 id="2022---going-open-source-with-&#x20AC;22m-in-funding-&#x1F389;">2022 - Going open-source with &#x20AC;2.2m in funding &#x1F389;</h3>
<p>To incorporate all the valuable feedback from early users, it was time to bring in external funding to accelerate the building process. We found supportive and knowledgeable investors who believed in GitMesh CE&apos;s mission to be the developer data tool of choice for developer-focused companies. With that, GitMesh CE hired more passionate individuals to keep the momentum going and grew the team to 10 people. </p>
<p>We released our open-source product into the world with enhanced applications and features to help DevTools collect and understand their developer data. We have a strong belief that our open-source approach will create value beyond our own product offering. We want to collaborate with everyone to build software for the developer-led era and create a vibrant and open ecosystem around our project. If you want to go far, go together.</p>
<h3 id="2023---nailing-strong-product-market-fit-&#x1F3AF;-">2023 - Nailing strong product-market fit &#x1F3AF; </h3>
<p>The goal for this year is to nail strong product-market fit. Countless DevTools - including some of the world&apos;s leading open-source organizations - are already happy users of GitMesh CE and use our product on a regular basis to understand their developer journey, manage their developer community, or identify sales opportunities within their data.</p>
<p>Our team of 12 is now supported by a growing open source community and we look forward with excitement to the months ahead.</p>
