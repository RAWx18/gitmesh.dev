<h3 id="responsibilities">Responsibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>All <strong>team members</strong> should contribute to creating and updating issues in Linear. Once an issue is created and labeled, it should be clear which area owner or project lead is responsible for reviewing it and ensuring it is tracked and adequately scoped.</li>
<li>Areas of ownership and projects may overlap, as all issues should be labeled accordingly. If an issue is part of a project, the <strong>project lead</strong> takes initial responsibility but can seek help from the <strong>area owner</strong> to refine the issue if needed. All issues without a project should be the responsibility of the area owner. For further details, refer to <a href="areas-of-ownership.html">Areas of Ownership</a> and <a href="project-based-development.html">Project-based Development</a>.</li>
<li>The <strong>product lead</strong> ensures that each cycle focuses on higher-priority issues that best align with the product&apos;s needs. To achieve this, the product lead is responsible for allocating resources and bridging the gaps between engineering, design, and product.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-management">Project management</h3>
<p>The team will scope the required work within Projects for major features and initiatives.</p>
<p>The project&apos;s lead is responsible for handling the project&apos;s lifecycle and communicating the project&apos;s status with the team:</p>
<ol>
<li>The project&apos;s scope and goals are set at the beginning of the project&apos;s lifecycle and discussed with the team.</li>
<li>The project milestones help to track the product&apos;s major features and initiatives.</li>
<li>The project&apos;s lead will then prioritize scope within milestones and update the team on the overall status.</li>
<li>At a later stage, the team&apos;s analytics tool tracks if the project&apos;s goals succeeded. The analysis of the extracted metrics is a continuous assessment.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="issues-management">Issues management</h3>
<p>Linear offers Custom Views to improve the management and organization of issues. By following the process outlined in the <a href="how-to-report-issues.html">How to report issues</a> section, we can ensure that the entire team knows the product&apos;s backlog and that everyone is accountable for maintaining the product.</p>
<p>Below is a list of <strong>custom views</strong> that provide insight into how the team can use them throughout the product&apos;s lifecycle:</p>
<h4 id="&#x1F6DF;-support">&#x1F6DF; <strong>Support</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>All issues reported by customers.</li>
<li>It allows the support person to monitor the issues&apos; status and the issue manager to prioritize issues.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="arrowforward-current-cycle">:arrow_forward: <strong>Current Cycle</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>All issues worked on in the current cycle, excluding support-related ones.</li>
<li>It helps the team to manage their work and measure progress and success. During the cycle review, there is a discussion of the unresolved issues.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="checkeredflag-ready-to-be-picked-up">:checkered_flag: <strong>Ready to be picked up</strong>:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Overview of all issues in the <em>TODO</em> state (planned but not started), grouped by project. In the same view, apart from the projects&apos; columns, there is also a column named <em>No project</em>, for all issues outside a project.</li>
<li>For issues within a project or without a project, the sorting is done by priority so that the team has a clear visualization of the most important issues they should handle next.</li>
<li>It helps to identify issues ready to be addressed within each part of the product. It also guides the discussion on which issues to move into the upcoming cycle during cycle planning.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="ship-cycle-plan">:ship: <strong>Cycle Plan</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>All planned issues, grouped by assignee, for the upcoming cycle.</li>
<li>It is used as a reference to ensure the team is adequately scoped and not overcommitted.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="openfilefolder-areas-of-ownership">:open_file_folder: <strong>Areas of Ownership</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Each area of ownership has its own view, filtered by label. Each view is grouped by status and ordered by priority.</li>
<li>The designated area owner is responsible for maintaining the issues within that area. This view should be used to ensure issues are placed in the correct status. This can be easily achieved by:<ul>
<li>keeping track of the ones in progress;</li>
<li>planning the most important ones and moving them into the TODO state after;</li>
<li>continuously checking the ones that are still in a discovery phase by keeping them in the backlog.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
