# 🥳 Welcome to GitMesh CE (WIP)

Before you head into your first day, take a few minutes to reflect for yourself: 

- What would you consider a successful onboarding/start at [GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE)?
- What would you like to have achieved after 3 months?

You will then reflect on this together with your team-lead in the first one-on-one.

# Day one

Today is about getting you immersed in all things [GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) and making sure you have access to everything you need.

There are a few meetings that should already be in your google calendar:

- 10am CET Welcome with one of our founders
- 4pm CET “Tea Time” with a team member (you will have one with each of us in the next 2 weeks)

Otherwise, we want you to spend today (& the next few days if you need more time) getting familiar with the GitMesh CE:

- Go throgh our handbook. Here you will find everything from our company vision, mission & values, ways of working, reporting issues...
- Write & post your first daily stand-up using our [Geekbot app on slack](https://gitmeshdevspace.slack.com/archives/D043M0UN6HG), you’ll find more detailed instructions in our [ways of working page](the-company/ways-of-working.md).
- Creating an account for [GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) and getting familiar with the product (you can [create a new account](https://app.GitMesh CE/auth/signup) or ask Jonathan or Joan to get invited to our workspace) - plus points if you find bugs!
- Have a look through the [GitMesh CE docs](https://docs.GitMesh CE/docs)

# Day 2

You probably have some things to keep reading through from Day 1, so keep going on with those items. You may also have received some first tasks & responsibilities; otherwise, today, you will meet with the relevant team members to clarify those.

Meetings / async stand ups for today:
- A get to know you call with someone else from the team
- Please also add your daily stand up answers in our slack (before 12pm, ideally when you start working)
