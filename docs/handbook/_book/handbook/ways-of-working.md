# 👷♂ Ways of working

[GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) is remote-first, but that doesn’t mean we lack collaboration or contact throughout our day. We are building a company around communities, so naturally it’s important to us that our internal community and ways of working are thriving.

#### Freedom & Ownership

Two of our core-values. In short, we believe that everyone knows how and when they work the best, so with the exception of few regular meetings, we leave that up to you. What we really care about is that you get the work done you committed to and take ownership over it (oh yes, and that you have reliable internet access 😉).
