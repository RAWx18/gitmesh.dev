# 😍 Employee benefits

### 📚 Book & personal-development budget

We encourage all gitmeshies to follow their curiosities and continually improve their skills. Whether it is books or courses for personal or career development, we are happy to support. Check out [this page ](expenses.md)to find out how to hand in expenses.

### 📃 Employee Option Plan

What better way to feel ownership than to be an owner? If you are a full-time employee at GitMesh CE we believe you should participate in the success of the company with shares. Check out [this page](employee-option-plan.md) for more info.

### 🖥️ Co-working space budget

If you want to work from a co-working space in your neighborhood let us know and we will reimburse you for the costs up to 200€/month.&#x20;

### 🏋️ Urban Sports Club Membership
