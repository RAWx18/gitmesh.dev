# 📄 Employee option plan

### What is an Employee Option Plan?

* A contract between employee and employer that grants stock options, i.e., employees have a right to purchase a set amount of company shares at a set price (exercise price)
* Specifically, we offer a “Virtual Share Option Plan” (VSOP) also known as granting “Phantom Shares”

### Why VSOP?

* In many European countries, especially Germany, VSOP are taxed more favorably for employees and are considerably easier to set up
* If you are a non-founder and receive shares after the founding of a company, the shares will be taxed according to their current Fair Market Value (FMV) at grant (just like your regular salary)
* FMV is most commonly linked to the latest funding round and valuation, therefore you would be paying a hefty tax at a high risk
* The VSOP model gives you a right to receive virtual shares that only materialize when [GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) exits
* At that moment shareholders commit a predefined amount of exit proceeds and the employee then receives currency in her bank account which is only taxable then
* That way, employees only pay taxes when their cash position allows them to do so and avoids the risk of capital losses

### What are the standard terms?

#### Vesting

Your shares are [vested](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp), we use standard terms of 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff meaning:

* Your shares will vest linearly on a monthly basis over 48 months
* If you leave the company before 1 year of work, you will not be able to exercise any shares

**Exercise Price**

The exercise price depends on the grant date and represents the current FMV (usually, the last valuation at a financing round is taken)
