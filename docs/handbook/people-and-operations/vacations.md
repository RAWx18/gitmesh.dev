# 🌴 PTO

We want you well-rested and motivated to do your best, so everyone gets **six weeks of vacation per year (30 days).**

Please do try and take your vacation days during the year, its important to have some down time and prevent over-working. If you get to the end of the year and you have some left over you can carry a max of 5 days over into the next.

### How do I request time off?:

1. Log into Remote.com
2. Go to “Time Off” on the sidebar
3. Press “Request time off” and fill out the request
4. You will get an email through Remote either confirming or denying your time off request

### Please also remember:

* Put in your time off requests as early as possible and no later than 2 weeks in advance; if you want to take more than 2 weeks (10 workdays) off, please discuss it with your team lead at least 2 months in advance.
* Block your time off in your calendar as “Out of Office” once your holiday is approved.
* You are responsible for handover or assigning one of your team members to take care of anything critical while you are gone.
