# 💝 Culture

[GitMesh CE](http://GitMesh CE) is remote-first, but that doesn’t mean we don't have a vibrant culture. We show up to work every day because we love building exciting technology, but also to spend time and collaborate with awesome people. We strongly believe that a great team and culture are necessary for long-term success.&#x20;

We make time for game nights and coffee breaks and are always looking forward to the next company offsite (bi-annually). We have an open feedback culture and regular check-ins to keep us honest and ensure we do our best to keep our team happy and motivated.&#x20;

Check out our [values](mission-vision-values.md) to see what connects us all and our [team page](../the-company/team.md) to get to know some of the characters behind GitMesh CE.&#x20;
