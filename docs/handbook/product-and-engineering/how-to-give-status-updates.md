# 🗓️ How to give status updates

### Daily Updates

The team should give daily asynchronous updates before 12:00 CET. These updates will be done in Linear through [#project-updates](how-to-give-status-updates.md#project-updates "mention") or [#non-project-tasks-updates](how-to-give-status-updates.md#non-project-tasks-updates "mention").

The **#daily-standup** slack channel will be synced with Linear to reflect everyone's work. This means that all product-development updates done through Linear, will automatically trigger a notification on Slack.

#### Project updates

Linear allows giving status reports on the health of the projects. Each project lead will be responsible for providing these updates on a daily basis and syncing with any project members if needed.

Within a project update, you should first update the project's health, followed by a comment. The comment should be especially descriptive if the project is not on tracked, or if it's blocked. You can refer to Linear's documentation on [Project Updates](https://linear.app/docs/project-updates) for guidance on how to do it properly.

Each update will trigger a notification to Slack's **#daily-standup** channel, and any related discussion can be done in the thread.

#### Non-project tasks updates

Some tasks might not belong to any project. For these tasks, the assignee should provide a daily status update in the task's comments.

Each update will trigger a notification to Slack's **#daily-standup** channel, and any related discussion can be conducted in the thread.

### Reminders

#### Slack

Everyone will receive a daily reminder in Slack at 08:00 CET to provide their daily update. You won't have to write anything on Slack. The reminder will simply include links to:

* The [**Current cycle**](https://linear.app/GitMesh CE/view/7003c49a-eb73-46ca-bfe6-ec73084c0006) linear view,  where you can provide your status update on non-project tasks.
* The [**Active projects**](https://linear.app/GitMesh CE/team/LFX/projects/active) linear view, where you can provide your project updates.
