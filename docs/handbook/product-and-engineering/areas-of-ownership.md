Areas of ownership

#### What does it mean to be an owner (🥇)?

As the owner of a segment, your responsibilities include:

* Ensuring quality.
* Coming up with ideas for improvement and suggesting them, with arguments, in our planning meetings.
* Freedom of decision-making to drive the area forward.
* Being the first point of contact for support tickets in that area.
* Management of other teammates that might be working with you.
* Communicate decisions to the rest of the team.
* Ensure that your co-owner is always up-to-date and that other experts have the most updated knowledge. You should do this through documentation in GitBook and following our [communication.md](../ways-of-working/communication.md "mention") guidelines

#### Other roles

* 🥈**Co-owner**: the co-owner acts as a temporary owner when the owner is unavailable. As a co-owner, you should ensure you are up to date with topics in that area and comfortable with the code.
* ✅ **Expert:** an expert on an area can tackle most tasks without much, or any, external help.&#x20;
* ⏳ **Learner:** someone that wants to develop in that area. It can be through pair programming or attending workshops at first and taking small tasks later.

### Managing issues

Issues will all be labelled with their Area of Ownership (see [how-to-report-issues.md](how-to-report-issues.md "mention")), and each area of ownership will have its own view on Linear. Some guidelines to manage those issues:

* It is the responsibility of the owner to keep that view clear.
* If someone assigns an issue to an area you own, and you think it was misplaced, ask the owner of the area where you think it should be.
* If someone assigns an issue to an area you own and you think it's wrong or makes no sense, communicate it with that person. You should have the final say, unless it comes from the founders or product lead.

### Cycles and status reports

Owners should give weekly status reports of their areas and prepare for cycle meetings.&#x20;

Every Thursday before 17:00 CET, owners will be prompted to give a status report every Thursday in the #areas-of-ownership channel. For each area, they should give a small report on its status.

* The status report should include:
  * What was the development in the past week?
  * If tasks were ongoing, are they on track?
  * If there has not been any progress or improvements in your area in some weeks, explain why (except for more straightforward areas, like Emails or signals).
* The prompt will also ask you if you need any time during the cycle meeting on Friday to talk about any of your areas. You should mention this if you want to push new tasks for your areas into the next cycle. Make sure tasks are created, described, and scoped before the meeting! But do not assign or add them to the cycle; we will do so during the meeting.

The person responsible for the cycle will plan accordingly based on your responses.

### Communicating decisions

For communication, we will follow our [communication.md](../ways-of-working/communication.md "mention") guidelines. Long-term decisions and information must be documented in GitBook. It will be the responsibility of the owner to make sure documentation is up-to-date.
