# 🧑🤝🧑 Pair programming

Each team member will do a pair-programming session every month. We are a very talented team with excellent knowledge in many areas, and this will help us ensure we learn from one another.&#x20;

Joan will send an update in #dev every month about pair programming. The team will be split in pairs, each having a leader and a follower.

* The leader will take charge when coding, while the follower will be doing support.
* The leader is responsible for scheduling the session.
* The session should be between one and two hours.

The pairs are mostly randomly generated but might be influenced by the areas of knowledge or tasks planned for the week. If there is someone from whom you would like to learn, reach out to Joan!
