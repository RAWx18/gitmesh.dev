# 🥳 Getting set up

Once you have signed up to gitmesh ce, there are a few key steps you need to take to start identifying qualified leads for your go-to-market team.&#x20;

1. **Connect** your first few [data sources](integrations/).
   * The more data sources, the better. If you go with just one to start, we recommend going with GitHub as it is a rich source for Developer data, which we then enrich with even more data points for you to use.&#x20;
   * Give it a few minutes to populate your workspace, and you will see your contacts and organization pages start to fill up.
2. **Invite your** colleagues to collaborate.
   * You can invite your teammates and give them admin or read-only access to your workspace. &#x20;
   * If you are not the owner of your company's GitHub account, make sure to invite that person as an admin so they can set up that data source for you.&#x20;
   * Once your colleagues are there, you will be able to collaborate. For example, create custom views with essential segments of your contacts or organizations pages, create [Tasks ](../guides/tasks.md)for yourself and teammates, and share Notes on specific contacts or organization profiles for your team to see.&#x20;
3. **Explore** the [contacts](../guides/contacts/) and [organizations](../guides/organizations/) that have interacted with your brand or product.
   * This is where the magic really begins... once your data has been pulled into gitmesh ce (make sure to give it a few minutes), you can start digging in.
   * Check out a contact profile to see all of the activities they have made with your brand or product, explore any [additional data points](../guides/contacts/contact-enrichment.md) we have added for you, and see if they are a qualified lead for a sale.&#x20;
4. **Explore** **insights** with our [reports](../guides/reports/).
   * Take a look at our activities, contact, or product-community fit report to find out about key trends like the most active contacts or popular activities in your developer data.
   * Build your own reports with our [custom report ](../guides/reports/custom-reports.md)builder.
5. **Take action** by setting up [Slack notifications or Hubspot sync.](../guides/automations/)
   * We have a two-way sync with HubSpot to make sure your contacts are fed straight to your CRM.
   * To make sure you react to key activities fast, you can set up a Slack notification, for example, when a new contact has joined.&#x20;
