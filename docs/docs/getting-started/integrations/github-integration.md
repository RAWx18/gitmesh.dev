### Set-up with admin permissions

1. Go to the [Integration settings](https://app.GitMesh CE/integrations) and follow the steps to connect GitHub.
2. Choose the workspace that you would like to connect.
3. Choose the repositories in the workspace that you would like to connect.

That’s it. We're now collecting all community activities from your connected repos, including pull requests, issues, stars, and forks.

### Set-up with missing permissions

If you are an organization member, you will most likely need your admin's approval to set up the integration to GitMesh CE. In order to do that successfully, you need to:

1. Invite the GitHub organization admin to GitMesh CE

Go to the [User Settings](https://app.GitMesh CE/settings?activeTab=users). Click on invite and follow the steps to invite the GitHub organization owner with an admin role.

2. Ask the GitHub organization owner to sign up to GitMesh CE

They will have received an email from us with an invitation to your GitMesh CE workspace. If they follow the link, they will be taken to a sign-up page where they will be able to join your workspace.

3. Ask them to approve your GitHub installation request

They should go over to the Integration settings and re-start the GitHub flow. Since they have the proper permissions, it will work for them.

That’s it!
