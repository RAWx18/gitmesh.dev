# 🔌 Integrations

Data is at the heart of everything that we do. That's why integrations naturally play a central role in our product.

If you’ve other data sources that you would like to connect to, you have two options at the moment:

* Build something custom with our [API](https://docs.gitmesh.ce/reference/getting-started-with-gitmesh-ce-api).
* Use [Pipedream](https://pipedream.com/apps/gitmesh-ce) to connect our app with 600+ sources.
