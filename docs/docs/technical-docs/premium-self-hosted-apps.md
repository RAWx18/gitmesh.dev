# 🗝 Premium self-hosted apps

All our premium features are within our public repository. However, they will need a special premium license to be used when self-hosting. To get a premium license, please [contact us](mailto:help@GitMesh CE). Currently, the premium self-hosted apps are:

* User management: invite colleagues to GitMesh CE with custom permissions. This code is part of the free Docker containers but will be deactivated by default. It will only be activated when getting a premium license
* [Signals](../guides/app-signals.md): the Signals app allows you to monitor different community platforms to find relevant content to engage with.
