# 🏚 Home

Home gives you a quick snapshot of key things that are happening in your developer data. You can get an overview of the core elements of GitMesh CE:

* Contacts
* Organizations
* Activities
* Active Integrations
* Open tasks

By default, Home displays data for the last 7 days across all connected platforms. Above the contacts element at the top, you can change the time period of displayed data (7, 14, or 30 days) and filter by connected platforms. This will affect all modules on Home except your active integrations and open tasks.

## Filters

filters allow you to filter contacts, organizations, and activities by platform or period.

* **Period**: You can display data in the last 7, 14, or 30 days
* **Platform**: You can filter data by a specific platform that you have connected.

## Contacts

* **Total contacts**: How many contacts were identified through your connected data sources, this could be developers interacting with you in community channels, using your product, or synced from your CRM in a given period (7, 14, 30 days)
* **New contacts**: How many new contacts joined and did their first activity in the selected time period. The result is displayed as a number (total new contacts in a given time period) with a relative change (to the previous time period) and as a graph (new contacts over a given time period). Below is a feed of the newest contacts, from which you can jump directly to each contact's profile.
* **Active contacts**: How many contacts did at least one activity in the given time period. The result is displayed as a number (total active contacts in a given time period) with a relative change (to the previous time period) and as a graph (active contacts over a given time period).

## Integrations

* **Active integrations**: This widget displays all your connected integrations. If there is a green dot next to your integration, it means that your integration is connected. If you notice any other than a green dot next to it means that your integration failed to connect or needs additional action.
