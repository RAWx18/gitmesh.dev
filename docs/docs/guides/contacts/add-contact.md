# Add contact

Contacts are created either automatically or manually.

## Automatic add

A new contact is added as soon as one of your integrations detects an activity that can't be assigned to an existing contact, GitMesh CE will automatically create a new contact (including this activity).

## Manual add

To create a contact manually, navigate to the contact's page and click **Add contact** in the top right corner of the page. You'll then have to fill out the following mandatory fields:

* Full Name
* At least one profile in Identities
* Contact since (the date they first interacted with your product or brand)
