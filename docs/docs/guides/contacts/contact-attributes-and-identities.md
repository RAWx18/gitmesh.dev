# Contact attributes & identities

Your contacts have rich information pertaining to them scattered across platforms they are active on. We call the different profiles **Identities** (think GitHub, Slack, or Twitter accounts). With GitMesh CE, we merge all the data from these different identities into one. We call the contact-specific data (e.g., their bio, their activity level) **Attributes**. We have default attributes, but you can also make your own custom ones.

## Attributes

### Default attributes

* **Display Name**: How a contact should be displayed in GitMesh CE
* **Email**: The email address of the contact
* **Contact Since**: The date on which the contact did the first activity in your community
* **Job Title**: The role the contact has in their organization
* **Organization**: The organization/company the contact belongs to
* **Bio**: A short description of the contact's bio (usually populated through GitHub or Twitter)
* **Location**: The place where the contact is located
* **Tags**: Any individual tags that you would like to add to organize and segment the contact

To edit default attributes, go to a contact's profile and

1. Click the three dots in the upper right corner of the Profile section
2. Click **Edit Contact**
3. Edit any details of the contact
4. Once you have edited your desired field, scroll to the bottom and click **Update Contact**

### Custom attributes

A custom attribute will show up on the right-hand side of your contact profile under contact identities. They allow you to add details beyond our default attributes to better segment your contacts. To add a custom attribute:

1. Click the three dots in the upper right corner of the Profile section
2. Click **Edit contact**
3. Scroll down to custom attributes and click **Manage custom attributes**
4. In the pop-up click **add custom attribute**
5. Select one of the **attribute types** from the drop-down (e.g., text, number, date, URL)
6. Insert the value in the name field and press update
7. Click **Update contact**

You can also edit your custom attributes at any time in this section, as well as delete them by clicking the trash icon next to the custom attribute.

## Identities

Identities include the different platforms contacts have and the profile URLs that belong to them (think GitHub, Discord, Stack Overflow, etc.). A contact may have several identities (aka profiles in community platforms) and GitMesh CE merges them into one.

These are the default identities:

* **Twitter**: The Twitter handle (@TwitterName) of a contact
* **Discord**: The Discord profile of a contact
* **GitHub**: The GitHub handle of a contact
* **Slack**: The Slack profile of a contact
* **DEV**: The DEV handle (@DEVName) of a contact

### How to manage identities

If you would like to add, change, or remove an identity manually, you can:

1. Click on **Manage** in the identity & custom attribute section in the contact profile (or click the three dots in the upper right corner of profile section, click **Edit contact** and scroll down to Identities)
2. Choose the platform you would like to add or remove by clicking the toggle
3. To add an identity, please fill in the profile user name of the respective platform
4. Click **update** to save your changes

### Add custom identities

If you would like to add a custom identity that is not part of the default list (e.g., an email or a phone number). You can do so by adding a custom attribute of that type to a profile. Just follow the instructions on how to add a custom attribute above. You will see these custom identities along with your other custom attributes.
