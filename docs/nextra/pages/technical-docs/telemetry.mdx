# ℹ Telemetry

We collect anonymized data from self-hosted versions in order to improve our product. This can be deactivated at any time, and any data that has already been collected can be deleted on request.

#### Why collect telemetry data?

We collect telemetry data to

* Improve our product: reliable usage data helps us to evaluate features and fix bugs.
* Prove that people are actually using [GitMesh CE](https://GitMesh CE/): Sage metrics help us justify our existence to investors and potential new customers to keep this project alive.

#### Deactivating telemetry

To deactivate telemetry, simply set `SEGMENT_WRITE_KEY=""` in the environment files.
