### 1. Connect Discord bot

Go to the [Integration settings](https://app.GitMesh CE/integrations) and follow the steps to connect Discord.

Give the GitMesh CE bot access to your Discord server.

Done! We’re now collecting your community's Discord activities.

### 2. Add Discord bot to private channels

By default, our bot can only fetch data from public channels. If you need a specific role to join channels and still want to collect the data from those channels, you must give the bot the suitable server role.

You can learn more about Discord server roles [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/214836687-Role-Management-101).

That's it! GitMesh CE now collects all messages, reactions, and server joiners from your Discord community. 🎉
