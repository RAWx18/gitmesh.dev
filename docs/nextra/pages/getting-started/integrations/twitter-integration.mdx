# Twitter integration

> 📣 Update about GitMesh CE’s Twitter integration
>
> In recent months, Twitter has made significant changes to its API, affecting its features and pricing. These alterations haven’t been communicated very openly regarding their implementation, impact, and timing.
>
> The team at gitmesh ce is nevertheless working hard to adapt in the best possible way. However, the latest price adjustments, which set API access to an exorbitant amount of $42,000 per month, won’t allow us to offer our Twitter integration as we did beforehand. The prior Twitter API was free and open, and we could include our Twitter integration in all plans, even our free Essential plan. With these new changes, we are now forced to adjust how we integrate data from Twitter.
>
> For now, Twitter will only be available on our Scale & Enterprise plan, and you will have to bring your own Twitter API key. You can get this for $100/month.
>
> **The good news?** The new Twitter integration will be more powerful, allowing you to search for Tweets that mention any keyword. On top of that, you can track followers of multiple Twitter accounts.
>
> We hope that you understand our decision and are equally excited about the new opportunities that this workflow offers, pulling even more insights from Twitter. If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach out to us via [email](mailto:help@gitmesh.ce) or [book a call](https://cal.com/team/GitMeshCE/intro-to-gitmesh-ce).
