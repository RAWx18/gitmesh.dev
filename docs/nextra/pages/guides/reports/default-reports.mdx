# Default Reports

## Available Reports

At the moment, GitMesh CE already has three default reports available: **Contacts report**, **Product-Community Fit report,** **and Activities report**.

To access the existing reports, go to the [reports section](https://app.GitMesh CE/reports) and click on one of the reports listed under Default reports. From this page you are able to open a report or to copy the public URL link to access the report public link.

## Widgets

Once you open a default report, each widget will be tailored to the specific data points being covered in the report. Depending on the type of widget, you will be able to filter by period and granularity. In addition to widget filtering, you will also have available report global filters, such as filter by platforms, which will impact all data within that report.

Most widgets will be interactive, so you can view data in detail, view insights, compare data through growth rates, and export data.
