# Welcome to GitMesh CE

GitMesh CE unifies all touchpoints developers have with your company or brand to help your go-to-market teams identify high-intent accounts.

GitMesh CE captures touchpoints across your community (e.g. GitHub or Reddit), product (open source or SaaS), or commercial channels (e.g. HubSpot). The data is pulled, cleaned, profiles are matched across platforms, and enriched with 3rd party data.

The result is a unified 360-view of the developers who engage with your product and community, which companies they work for, and where they stand in their personal customer journey.

## Getting Started

To get started for free, either [sign up for our cloud version](https://www.gitmesh.ce/sign-up) or take a look at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LF-Decentralized-Trust-labs/gitmesh).

## Why GitMesh CE?

If you're building a product for developers, your buying journey happens outside of what traditional CRMs and CDPs can cover.

Developers rely primarily on peer recommendations. They want to "build before they buy". And they are not going to sign up for your whitepaper. Once convinced of your product, they can become strong advocates, but your economic buyer is most likely someone else - how do you identify them?

Marketing, Sales, Customer Success, and DevRel teams lack the needed data to identify and target the right accounts, drive growth, and deliver a world-class developer experience.

GitMesh CE is built for developer-focused companies. We combine data from GitHub, LinkedIn, your product, and many other sources to understand which companies engage with your developer product. We can sync insights with your CRM so you can prioritize the right accounts and build a strong pipeline.
